# Introduction

This is a python notebook where I analyse data from a client selling bicycles and accessories.
The aim is to recommend which customers to approach from a target dataset to market their products with high confidence of success.

## Data Quality Assessment

I analyse data for possible quality issues in the following areas:

* Accuracy - correctness of values
* Completeness - all data fields with values
* Consistency - no contradictions between values in same column, table
* Currency - values should be up to date
* Relevancy - data applicable to task at hand
* Validity - data contains allowable values
* Uniqueness - there should be no duplicates
